## 🎯 **Project Highlights**
After extensive business research, EDA, & Feature Engineering, we tested several models for Cambio Labs' Resource Recommendation system.

- We found Random Forest to be the most effective for the problem, with KNN and DNN as runner's up.

## 👩🏽‍💻 **Setup and Installation**

The majority of our work was done in Google Colab Notebooks then uploaded to GitHub. To run models & scripts

1. Select the '.ipynb' file you want.
2. Download it.
3. Run the notebook locally or upload to Google Colab.

Final datasets used are available in the repository under the 'Data' folder, as well as original, sample data.

## 🏗️ **Project Overview - Entrpreneur Compass Tool**
Our project focuses on developing machine learning models that transform data into tailored resource recommendations, allowing small business owners to grow without wasting time on figuring out how.

**Describe:**

- We worked on this project as AI Studio Fellows for [Cambio Labs](https://www.cambiolabs.org/) through the Break Through Tech Program.
- Cambio Labs™ empowers low income social entrepreneurs and workers through educational programs, learning technology, and by providing access to investment and job opportunities.
- With our project, we aimed to
  - Streamline Cambio Labs’ workflow - Automating resource matching, saving time, reducing manual effort
  - Leverage data and machine learning - Make recommendations faster, accurate, and scalable
- Scope: doing an in-depth analysis of possible models and presenting our findings in order to position Cambio Labs to create a user-friendly tool.
- Impact
  - Increasing success rate of small business owners finding relevant and impactful resources
  - Simplified yet informative user onboarding experience
  - Target a broader group of business owners with a larger set of recommended resources
