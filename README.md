## 🎯 **Project Highlights**
After extensive business research, EDA, & Feature Engineering, we tested several models for Cambio Labs' Resource Recommendation system.

- We found Random Forest to be the most effective for the problem, with KNN and DNN as runner's up.

## 👩🏽‍💻 **Setup and Installation**

The majority of our work was done in Google Colab Notebooks then uploaded to GitHub. To run models & scripts

1. Select the '.ipynb' file you want.
2. Download it.
3. Run the notebook locally or upload to Google Colab.

Final datasets used are available in the repository under the 'Data' folder, as well as original, sample data.

## 🏗️ **Project Overview - Entrpreneur Compass Tool**
Our project focuses on developing machine learning models that transform data into tailored resource recommendations, allowing small business owners to grow without wasting time on figuring out how.

**Describe:**

- We worked on this project as AI Studio Fellows for [Cambio Labs](https://www.cambiolabs.org/) through the Break Through Tech Program.
- Cambio Labs™ empowers low income social entrepreneurs and workers through educational programs, learning technology, and by providing access to investment and job opportunities.
- With our project, we aimed to
  - Streamline Cambio Labs’ workflow - Automating resource matching, saving time, reducing manual effort
  - Leverage data and machine learning - Make recommendations faster, accurate, and scalable
- Scope: doing an in-depth analysis of possible models and presenting our findings in order to position Cambio Labs to create a user-friendly tool.
- Impact
  - Increasing success rate of small business owners finding relevant and impactful resources
  - Simplified yet informative user onboarding experience
  - Target a broader group of business owners with a larger set of recommended resources

## 📊 **Data Exploration**
### Datasets Used
* The dataset(s) used: origin, format, size, type of data
### Data Exploration & Insights
To process our data, we combined our individual responses, results, and resource datasets to create one unified dataset. From there, we performed EDA & extracted insights. 

I. Respondent Demographics & Status
- Location: **High concentration in The Bronx (most respondents)**, followed by Manhattan and Brooklyn.
- Income: **Overwhelmingly low-income**, with the vast majority reporting family income Under $25,000.
- Housing: **Highly concentrated in affordable housing**, primarily NYCHA public housing and Section 8 Voucher holders.
- Employment: A mix of Employed, Unemployed, and Self-Employed individuals.
- Tech Access: Near-universal access to a Smartphone for virtual training, with many also having access to a laptop/computer.

II. Entrepreneurial Interest & Stage
- Business Stage: Most ventures are in **the very early stages**, predominantly the Idea Stage or Planning/Getting started phase.
- Program Experience: A significant number of respondents appear to be **new to formal training**, as prior program/accelerator participation data is largely missing (likely indicating "None").
- Focus: A **clear interest in Social Entrepreneurship** (impact-focused) and **Cooperative Businesses** (community-owned) alongside general entrepreneurship.
- Money: Majority no external funding or profit

III. Data Quality and Gaps
- Key Missing Data: The highest missing values were for Language preference other than English (suggesting English is sufficient for almost all) and details on prior external funding.
- Financial Status: High number of missing/non-applicable values for questions about being cash flow positive or profitable, which aligns with the finding that most businesses are pre-revenue.
- Majority N/A or No in regards to challenges facing their business that could clarify the type of support they need

### Challenges & Assumptions
* Given only a very small set of sample data, we struggled significantly when it came to increasing accuracy and generalizing our models.

## 🧠 **Model Development**

coming soon

* Model(s) used (e.g., CNN with transfer learning, regression models)
* Feature selection and Hyperparameter tuning strategies
* Training setup (e.g., % of data for training/validation, evaluation metric, baseline performance)


---

## 📈 **Results & Key Findings**
coming soon 

* Performance metrics (e.g., Accuracy, F1 score, RMSE)
* How your model performed
* Insights from evaluating model fairness

**Potential visualizations to include:**

* Confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, feature importance plot, prediction distribution, outputs from fairness or explainability tools

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

coming soon

* What are some of the limitations of your model?
* What would you do differently with more time/resources?
* What additional datasets or techniques would you explore?
